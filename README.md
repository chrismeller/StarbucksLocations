Contains a single commit for each day that batches up all changes to the Starbucks dataset as a CSV file.

Deletes will obviously be stores that seem to have closed and adds are new stores that have opened.

This is a work in progress. There is additional data that needs to be included in this dataset and it needs to get properly automated so we hav e a regular commit daily at a particular time.
